# sap hana config
sap hana configuration changes detector

Script to detect configuration changes of SAP HANA installation.

It is **not** based on m_configuration_changes. It actually compares configuration before/after and reportes what was changed.

The connection needs to be maintained to SystemDB, not tenant.
